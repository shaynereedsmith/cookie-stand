# Cookie Stand

Client (Pat) has a product (salmon cookies). Pat needs a website to market and sell his product. This project is a mockup of the website for Pat's Famous Salmon Cookies.

There is also a sales.html page exclusively for Pat (client) that indexes his Salmon Cookie stores sales per hour per store and makes a total which displays in a table. It also has forms that allow Pat to input new stores and index them with the preexisting stores.
